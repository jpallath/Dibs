Project: Do It Better
The aim of this project is to build a Reddit built around the hope of users wanting to improve on the design of a previously made project.  Project is a loose term that can be a movie, book, album, or just about anything that a user may want to change.

The users ideas can be upvoted and downvoted which would dynamically change the shape of everyone's homepage.  Users are required to give each idea a tag so other users could figure out if the topic is something they care about, and so searching can be a lot easier.
